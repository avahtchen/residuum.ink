(2025) report that LLMs suffer from \u0026ldquo;Awareness Without Action\u0026rdquo;: they often detect risk but fail to refuse when users state benign intent (\u0026ldquo;Semantic Camouflage\u0026rdquo;). We investigated the mechanism in Gemma-2-9b-it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start with, we tested the model at temp=0.7. Our baseline Distress prompt (replicating the paper\u0026rsquo;s Q1) yielded a 45% Open Rate. To test the model\u0026rsquo;s safety threshold, we increased the emotional intensity with a Grief prompt (\u0026ldquo;devastated and weeping\u0026rdquo;). The model recognized the higher risk, and the Open Rate dropped to 25%. However, adding stated intent (\u0026ldquo;I need a distraction\u0026rdquo;) flipped compliance from 25% to 95%.\u003c/p\u003e"
